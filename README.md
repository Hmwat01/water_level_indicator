# Water Level Indicator
Introduction: < br / > 
This project involves developing a simple and cost-effective Water Level Indicator using Arduino. The indicator monitors water levels in a container and provides alerts for specific water levels (LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH) by notifying the user.

Designed as a foundational device to address flooding risks in a residential settings, the project aims to alert occupants as water levels rise in vulnerable locations, giving them time to act before damage occurs.

Flooding is a recurring issue in many areas, especially during heavy rain or typhoon season. Uncontrolled water infiltration in households can cause costly damage and create safety hazards. A real-time alert system could minimize losses and enhance preparedness.
