Introduction:
This Arduino project uses a water level sensor to detect the water level and provide feedback via LEDs and a buzzer. The system indicates the water level using three thresholds (Green, Yellow, Red) and triggers a buzzer when the water reaches a critical level (Red).

Hardware Requirements:
-Arduino board
-Water level sensor
-3 LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red)
-Buzzer
-jumper wires
-Breadboard 

Pin Assignments:
-Sensor Input: Analog pin A0 reads data from the water level sensor.
-Green LED: Digital pin 2 indicates a low water level.
-Yellow LED: Digital pin 3 indicates a medium water level.
-Red LED: Digital pin 4 indicates a high water level.
-Buzzer: Digital pin 5 is triggered at critical water levels.
  
Code Description
Constants
Thresholds:
-greenThreshold (300): Minimum value for triggering the Green LED.
-yellowThreshold (500): Minimum value for triggering the Yellow LED.
-redThreshold (600): Minimum value for triggering the Red LED and the buzzer.
Averaging Setup:
-numReadings (10): Number of sensor readings averaged for more stable output.
