Introduction
This Arduino project uses a water level sensor to detect the water level and provide feedback via LEDs and a buzzer. The system indicates the water level using three thresholds (Green, Yellow, Red) and triggers a buzzer when the water reaches a critical level (Red).

Hardware Requirements
Arduino board
Water level sensor
3 LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red)
Buzzer
Resistors (as required for LEDs)
Connecting wires
Breadboard (optional)
Pin Assignments
  
Sensor Input: Analog pin A0 reads data from the water level sensor.
Green LED: Digital pin 2 indicates a low water level.
Yellow LED: Digital pin 3 indicates a medium water level.
Red LED: Digital pin 4 indicates a high water level.
Buzzer: Digital pin 5 is triggered at critical water levels.
  
Code Description
Constants
Thresholds:
greenThreshold (300): Minimum value for triggering the Green LED.
yellowThreshold (500): Minimum value for triggering the Yellow LED.
redThreshold (600): Minimum value for triggering the Red LED and the buzzer.
Averaging Setup:
numReadings (10): Number of sensor readings averaged for more stable output.
  
Variables
readings[numReadings]: Array to store sensor values.
readIndex: Tracks the current index in the readings array.
total: Stores the sum of all sensor readings.
average: Calculates the average sensor reading.
  
Workflow
Setup Phase

Initialize all LEDs and the buzzer as output pins.
Set up the readings array with initial values of 0.
Start the serial communication for debugging.
Main Loop

Read sensor data from the water level sensor (analogRead(A0)).
Update the readings array and calculate a moving average for smoother sensor values.
Print the averaged value to the serial monitor for debugging.
LED and Buzzer Logic

Compare the average sensor value with the thresholds:
Red Threshold: If the average >= redThreshold, turn on the Red LED and buzzer.
Yellow Threshold: If the average >= yellowThreshold, turn on the Yellow LED.
Green Threshold: If the average >= greenThreshold, turn on the Green LED.
No Water Detected: If the average is below all thresholds, turn off all indicators.
Delay

Add a short delay (100ms) to allow sensor readings to stabilize before the next iteration.
